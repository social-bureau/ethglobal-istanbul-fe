### Frontend Development
<strong>React</strong>: Used for building the user interface, leveraging its component-based architecture for a responsive and dynamic experience.
<strong>CSS and Tailwind</strong>: These were used for styling the application. Tailwind, a utility-first CSS framework, enabled rapid and responsive design implementation.

### Backend Development
<strong>Nest.js</strong>: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.
<strong>Firebase Real-time Database & Hosting</strong>: Provided backend services, real-time database for storing and syncing data in real-time, and hosting services.
<strong>Firebase Storage</strong>: Used for storing files like images and documents securely in the cloud.
Blockchain Integration
<strong>IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)</strong>: Utilized for decentralized storage, making the platform more secure and resilient.
<strong>Solidity</strong>: The primary programming language for writing smart contracts on Ethereum and other blockchain platforms.
<strong>Hardhat</strong>: A development environment for Ethereum, enabling tasks like testing, debugging, and deployment of smart contracts.
<strong>Metamask & WalletConnect</strong>: Integrated to provide users with options for connecting their wallets, enhancing the platformâ€™s security and user experience.

### Blockchain Testnets Used
Multiple testnets were utilized to ensure the application's functionality across different blockchain environments. These included:

| chain                    | name     | contract address                                                                                                                                            |
